Project Began: January 16, 2018 <br />
Purpose: Created my personal website with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. My intentions for creating this website is to show a few of my programming skills related to Web Development and also an easy way to present all my achievements that Iâ€™ve done throughout my college career. In my website you can find my resume, volunteering experience, certificates and more. <br />
